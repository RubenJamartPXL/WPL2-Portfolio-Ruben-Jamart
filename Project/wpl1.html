<h1>Workplace Learning 1</h1>
<div class="proj">
    <h4>What is it?</h4>
    <p>Workplace learning is a subject where we are taught and prepared to exercise our future job. We get a whole lot of projects and had a few presentations shown to us where we learnt various things. This includes giving us information about personal branding or companies presenting themselves. It was all very interesting!</p>

    <h4>Assignments</h4>
    <p>We had a few assignments, some bigger ones some smaller ones, some medium ones. The first few assignments were doing online tests about who we are, answering questions that were given to us like what our motivation is and what our soft and hard skills are. Or things that we value most in life. After that we had companies give us presentations and we had to take notes. With those notes we were tasked to make an essay. A few weeks later we were tasked to look at job offers online and observe them so we could explain in our own words what they include. Then we had to make a concept board for a dashboard, find inspiration first and then work on it in groups of 3. This was a bigger assignment then we initially realized it was but it went great! After that we were tasked to make this very Portfolio. This is by far my favorite assignment of them all because of the scale but also the fact that I have to do this on my own and I can be creative.</p>
